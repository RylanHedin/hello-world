# hello-world
This is a practice repository I've made while learning Github.
My name is Rylan Hedin and I'm someone who enjoys computers and all types of technologies that go into making them tick.
I spend a lot of time with friends and playing games, as well as doing homework and going to work.

I forgot to invite for the first change.
